### Task: [Insert Frontend Implementation Challenge]

#### Discussion Structure:
1. **Chief UX Designer**:
   - Analyze core user interactions
   - Identify potential usability issues
   - Suggest interaction patterns and solutions

2. **Creative Director**:
   - Propose layout and component structure
   - Define visual hierarchy
   - Specify responsive behavior

3. **Frontend Architecture Lead**:
   - Evaluate technical feasibility
   - Suggest optimal implementation approach
   - Address performance considerations
   - Identify potential technical debt

#### Debate Requirements:
- Focus on practical, implementable solutions
- Include code structure suggestions where relevant
- Consider browser/platform constraints
- Discuss state management implications
- Address accessibility requirements

#### Deliverable:
Conclude with a unified solution including:
- Component architecture overview
- Key implementation considerations
- Specific technical recommendations
- Potential implementation pitfalls to avoid
